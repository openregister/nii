Notes on the National Information Infrastructure in a TiddyWiki5:

  $ sudo npm install -g tiddlywiki
  $ tiddlywiki nii --server
  $ open http://localhost:8080

The wiki was seeded from the spreadsheet https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/254174/20131031_NII_data.CSV found at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-information-infrastructure which contains multiple encoding issues, requiring manual fixing.
