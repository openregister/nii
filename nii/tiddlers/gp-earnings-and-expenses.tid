The GP Earnings and Expenses Enquiries (EEQs) provide a detailed study of the earnings and expenses of both contractor and salaried GPs in the UK. The reports are agreed by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which is chaired by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) and has representation from the four UK Health Departments, NHS Employers, NHS England and the British Medical Association.
