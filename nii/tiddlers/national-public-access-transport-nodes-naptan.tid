NaPTAN is Britain's national system for uniquely identifying points of access to public transport. It is a core component of the national transport information infrastructure and is used by a number of other UK standards and information systems. There is a NaPTAN record for every bus stop, railway station, airport, ferry terminal etc. in England, Scotland and Wales. Record attributes include co-ordinates (OSGR and Lat-Long), NPTG locality reference, name components and SMS code.
