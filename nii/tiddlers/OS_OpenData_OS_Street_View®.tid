As one of our range of backdrop mapping products, Ordnance Survey's OS Street View is street-level, backdrop map data that is specifically designed for online applications, as it can be downloaded quickly from both the Internet and Intranet.

It provides a scanned image of street-level mapping that can be combined with other data in a geographical information system (GIS), enabling you to clearly visualise a wide range of information in a geographical context. The street-level detail of OS Street View makes it particularly useful for displaying specific localities.
