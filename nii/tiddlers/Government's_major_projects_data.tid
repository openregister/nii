As part of the transparency policy for publication of major projects data the Major Projects Authority (MPA) has published its first annual report. It includes a set of combined data of the Government Major Projects Portfolio (GMPP), progress and future priorities. In addition, each government department has published detailed information about their GMPP. This includes the MPA RAG rating, key project data including financial information (whole life cost, annual budget and forecast spend) and timetable. This data is 6 months in arrears and will be updated every 12 months.
