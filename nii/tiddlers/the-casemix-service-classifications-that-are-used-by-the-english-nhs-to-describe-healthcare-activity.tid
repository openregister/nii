title: The Casemix Service - classifications that are used by the English NHS to describe healthcare activity
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

<<<
The Casemix Service designs and refines classifications that are used by the English NHS to describe healthcare activity. These classifications underpin PbR from costing through to payment, and support local commissioning and performance management. The service supports Payment by Results (PbR), as payment is linked to activity and adjusted for Casemix. This system ensures a fair and consistent basis for hospital funding, rather than being reliant on historic budgets and the negotiating skills of individual managers.
